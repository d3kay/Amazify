# Amazify
East-West University is launching ‘Amazify’, a Google Chrome browser extension. It is a product research tool designed for Amazon.com. While the regular search bar on Amazon works well for consumers searching for their desired products, it falls short to meet the needs of the sellers themselves. Amazify was designed to offer sellers a quick way to find and evaluate detailed information about a product on Amazon from a seller’s point of view. Amazify shall provide sellers with detailed information on a particular product such as the number of sellers, estimated monthly sales, estimated monthly revenue, the total number of reviews, overall user rating, and price history. With Amazify, our clients will save time and frustration, allowing them to find profitable niches quickly and start selling. Our primary marketing objective is to convince sellers on Amazon that this software will reduce their workload while saving their time, help them to quickly find the right products to sell, and overall make their business more efficient and profitable.
